# Pac Man Exercise

This is an exercise I completed as an assignment for the MIT- xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohert. This exercise includes a web-page where a PacMan moves accross the screen. The PacMan should reverse the direction that it is moving and the direction that it is facing when it reaches the end of the screen.

To run this project, download the files included and save them all in the same path on your machine. Run the html in your browser.

Next in this repository, I would like to add several PacMan images that can interacte with each other
